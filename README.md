# CA_housing_analysis
Census 1990 data on CA block group median house values


This is an update of the material that was previously found in my repository called AnalyzeCAhousingData.

At present (July 2021) there are 3 parts: Part01, Appendix A, and Appendix B.  A Part02 and an Appendix C are to follow.

I explore a wide range of predictive models for this California housing dataset.  The response variable is median house value.

Some of the noteworthy elements of the investigation include: 

(a) introducing a valuable new predictor---an urbanacity metric

(b) finding a transformation for longitude that dramatically increases its predictive power

(c) showing how we can enhance output from a Gibbs sampler to improve the imputation of censored data.

Items (a) - (c) are found in Part01, Appendix A, and Appendix B.  The two appendices focus on imputing values for censored data.
